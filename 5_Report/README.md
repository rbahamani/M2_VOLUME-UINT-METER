* A Volume Unit (VU) meter is a standard device that represents the signal level in audio equipment. This project “VU Meter Circuit using ATmega32” makes the representation process much easier since it avoids the use of any physical medium to establish the connection between the audio equipment or audio source and the circuit of the project. This way we can eliminate the hassle of using more components. It uses a bar graph LED for a visual representation of the audio.
